It gives you a quick answer to the question: <i>where is my gene of interest expressed/enriched in the adult fly?</i><br>
For each gene & tissue, you're given the mRNA SIGNAL (how abundant the mRNA is), the mRNA ENRICHMENT (compared to whole flies), and the Affymetrix PRESENT CALL (out of 4 arrays, how many times it was detectably expressed).<p>
